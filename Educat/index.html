                <h2>The solution to all your online learning hurdles</h2>
                <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                    morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of
                    cultural heritage from one generation to
                    the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners,
                    critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and
                    complex vocational skills.</p>

                <h2>Transforming Education in the world</h2>
                <p>Many public schools provide a free education through the government. Parents may send their own
                    children to a private schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot
                    go to school, because their countries
                    do not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough
                    money, or because the children have to work for money. or because the society have negative
                    prejudice on education for girls. The city
                    of Alexandria in Egypt. established in 330 BCE. became the successor to Athens as the intellectual
                    cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.
                    European civilizations suffered a
                    collapse of literacy and organisation following the fall of Rome in CI 416.

                <h2>Lets grow together</h2>
                <p>Education began in prehistory. as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed
                    necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                    imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge. values,
                    and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                    skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed
                    in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

                    1607 Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.
